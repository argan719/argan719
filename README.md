### Hi there, I'm Jihyun 👋

I am a System Software Engineer with a deep passion for building the foundational technologies that power next-generation vehicles. My core focus lies at the intersection of embedded systems, Linux, and AI, with a specialized interest in the automotive industry. <br>

My goal is to develop robust, real-time software that brings intelligent and safe automation to life. <br>


### 🔭 My Core Interests & Focus Areas:
- <b>System Architecture & Embedded C/C++:</b> Designing and building robust, real-time embedded systems from the ground up. My expertise lies in architecting high-performance software in C and C++ that runs efficiently on resource-constrained hardware.<br>
- <b>Linux Kernel & Hardware Enablement (ARM):</b> Specializing in hardware bring-up and systems programming on ARM architectures. I have hands-on experience developing Board Support Packages (BSP), customizing the Linux kernel, and writing drivers to enable full hardware functionality.<br>
- <b>Next-Generation Automotive Software:</b> Developing safety-critical software for the Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) ecosystem. Experienced in creating solutions for vehicle control units, real-time communication (e.g., CAN), and comprehensive SILS/HILS validation.<br>
- <b>AI Systems at the Edge:</b> Engineering intelligent systems by deploying optimized AI models directly on embedded hardware. My current focus is on the practical application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for in-vehicle systems, from advanced diagnostics to interpreting complex sensor data. <br>


### 🚀 Latest Project Highlights:
- <b>On-Device Hybrid LLM Voice Assistant:</b>
Engineered a fully on-device voice assistant featuring a real-time, dual-LLM routing engine. The system intelligently delegates incoming commands to one of two different LLM models based on command type and complexity.
This architecture achieves optimal performance and capability—all while ensuring zero cloud dependency, minimal latency, and complete user privacy.

- <b>Modern AI on Embedded Linux (GCC Backporting & BitNet Porting):</b>
Executed a complex toolchain upgrade by successfully backporting GCC 12 into a legacy Yocto SDK environment originally built with GCC 9.
This critical, foundational work unlocked modern C++ features and compiler optimizations, directly enabling the successful porting and optimization of the cutting-edge BitNet (1-bit LLM) architecture for a resource-constrained ARM target.
